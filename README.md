Description
-----------

The **new** LinuxCounter *Project* – was created in order to re-vive 
(and – re-place) the good *old* linux counter [project](counter.li.org).
Since January 11, 2012 – [counter.li.org] – redirects **directly** to
[linuxcounter.net]; and thus, [linuxcounter.net] – is the only (and – main) real
linux counter, with the largest base of users.

The **original** Linux Counter – was run by a non-profit member-ship organization
(called – the *Linux Counter Project*). This organization – was created on {the 1st of May, 1999}, taking over the running of the counter: from Harald Tveit
Alvestrand (who has been running the project since 1993). Harald Alvestrand – is 
a chief executive officer, of the organization.

It – was started as a "for fun" project, – to find out: 
how many Linux users – there are, world-wide?

The basic idea – is for people: to register them-selves – as being a Linux user...
Of course: this way – you won't get all Linux users counted, –
as not every Linux user – will register it-self, at the Linux Counter site!

Thus, the only way to *know* the number of Linux users (world-wide) – is to make 
a guess (preferably: a *not-too-wild* guess) of the {number of Linux users}. 
Not making wild guesses? – there is only one way to go: statistics; – and so, 
there – we are.

Also – see this WikiPedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Counter): 
for information about the Linux Counter Project.

On the 10th of september in 2011, we – also were [slash-dotted](http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/09/10/1249257/the-linux-counter-relaunches).
