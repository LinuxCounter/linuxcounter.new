De-scription
------------

The *new* «Linux counter» Project – was created as a [re-placement](http://counter.li.org).

Since year №2.012 (January; the №11-th), – the address – was changed: 

    from [HTTP://Counter.Li.Org]
        –
            to [HTTPS://WWW.LinuxCounter.Net]

– to host the only (and – main) real Linux counter: with the largest base of **users**.

The *original* counter – was ran by a *Non*-Profit member-ship (organization,
called – «The *Linux* counter Project»), – which – was created on 
{the 1-st of May, 1999, anno domini}: taking over (the running; of counter) 
from **Harald Tveit Alvestrand** (who – has been running (the project) 
since 1993) – a chief executive officer (of the Organization).

It – was started (as a «For fun!» project), – to find out: 

    How many Linux users – are there? (World-wide)

The basic idea (for people) – is to register our-selves, as being a *Linux* users!…

Of course: *this* way – you – won't get *all* Linux users *counted*… –
as not **every** *Linux* user – would register (it-self; at the Linux counter **site**).

Thus: the only way (to *know* the number, of Linux users; **World**-wide), – is – 
to make a *guess* (preferably – a not too *wild* guess) – of the {number}, of Linux *users*… 

Not making wild guesses?
There – is only *one* way, to go: **statistics**; – and so – there – we are! :(

Also; see – this: an [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Counter), of Wiki-Pedia:
for information **about** a Linux counter project.

On the 10-th of September (in 2.011, anno domini) – the project was (also) [Slash Dotted](http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/09/10/1249257/the-linux-counter-relaunches)…
