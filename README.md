Description
-----------

The **new** Linux counter *Project* – was created to re-vive (and – re-place)
the good *old* linux [counter](http://counter.li.org).

Since 2012 (anno domini), January, the 11th, – the address – changed: 

    from – [http://counter.li.org]
    to – [https://www.linuxcounter.net]

– to host the only (and – main) real Linux counter: with the *largest* base, of **users**.

The *original* Linux Counter – was run by a non-profit member-ship organization
(called – the *Linux Counter* Project). This organization – was created on {the 1st of May, 1999}:
taking (over the running, of counter) from **Harald Tveit Alvestrand** (who – has been running 
the project, since 1993) – a chief executive officer, of the organization.

It – was started as a "for fun!" project, – to find out: 

    How many Linux users – are there: World-wide?

The basic idea – is for people: to register, them-selves, – as being a Linux user…
Of course: this way – you won't get all Linux users *counted*, –
as not *every* Linux user – would register, it-self, at the Linux Counter site!

Thus, – the only way, to *know* the number (of Linux users; **World**-wide), – is – 
to make a **guess** (preferably – a *not-too-wild* guess): of the {number}, of Linux users… 

Not making wild guesses? – there – is only one way, to go: *statistics*; 
– and so (there) – we – are!

Also: see this [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Counter), of Wiki-Paedia:
for – information about the Linux counter **Project**.

On the 10th of September (in 2011), we – were (also) [slash-dotted](http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/09/10/1249257/the-linux-counter-relaunches)!
